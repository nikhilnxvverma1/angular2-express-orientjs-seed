# Sanity

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.31 and 
adapted to work with express js server. Additionally, it optionally uses [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/) 
at the backend for storage.

2. *Optional: Make sure [OrientDB server is installed and running](http://orientdb.com/docs/2.1/Tutorial-Run-the-server.html)
3. npm run build:client
4. npm run compile:server
5. npm start
6. npm watch:client

_Note: If you want to use the database, go to server/index.ts and change the flag `iWantToUseDatabase` to true._
